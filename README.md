# Handle-counter
App that automatically counts pieces in frame for galvanic line
This is my portfolio project, so it likely won't have much use other than to show it in resume
the project contains two scripts: 
main.py is an app, which takes a direct video stream from camera 
and on button click, performs object detection, visualising results and writing number of found objects in text format
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
autoannotations.py is a tool, that i used to reduce labor intencity of data annotation process, and also to monitor model performance
